                <ul class="block">
                    <li>"NotEnoughCoins" refers to the digital software provided through the website for use in the online
                    game, Hypixel Skyblock.</li>
                    <li>"Service" refers to the access and use of NotEnoughCoins.</li>
                    <li>"You" refers to the individual or entity accessing and using NotEnoughCoins.</li>
                </ul>
                <ol class="block">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Abusive Conduct Prohibited:</strong><br>
                    We reserve the right to terminate your access to NotEnoughCoins if you engage in abusive behavior
                    towards any members of our community.
                </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Prohibition on Distribution:</strong><br>
                    We reserve the right to terminate your access to NotEnoughCoins if you are found to be distributing
                    or attempting to distribute copies of the mod without our express written consent.
                </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Troll Tickets / Misleading Users:</strong><br>
                    We reserve the right to terminate your access to NotEnoughCoins if you are intentionally wasting
                    staff time or giving incorrect information about the mod to members of our community and beyond.
                </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>No Liability for In-Game Flip Purchases:</strong><br>
                    We are not liable for any in-game flip purchases made using the mod, and you use the mod at your own
                    risk.
                </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Use of the Mod at Your Own Risk:</strong><br>
                    By using NotEnoughCoins, you agree that the mod is used at your own risk and you will not be
                    entitled to a refund in the event that you are banned from Hypixel.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Service Termination:</strong><br>
                    There is no guarantee on the period of time that our packages will remain functional. The operation
                    of NotEnoughCoins is reliant on covering monthly fixed costs and possible development time. By
                    purchasing NotEnoughCoins, you agree that the service may be terminated at any time and without
                    prior notice.
                </li>
                </ol>
